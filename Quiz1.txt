Question 3
Which of the following is an example of a reproducible study?
Your Answer 		Score 	Explanation
The study's analytic data are publicly available, but the computer code is not. 			
The study's analytic data and computer code are not publicly available, but the study was simple enough to be repeated by an independent investigator. 			
The study's original authors re-run their computer code on their analytic data and confirm publicly that the findings match those of the published results. 			
The study's analytic data and computer code for the data analysis are publicly available. When the code is run on the analytic data, the findings are identical to the published results. 	Correct 	1.00
